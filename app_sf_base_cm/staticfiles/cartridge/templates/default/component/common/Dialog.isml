<iscontent type="text/html" charset="UTF-8" compact="true">

<!---
This is just a dummy ISML template since the renderTemplate is a required parameter of a pagelet definition.
It is not actually needed for the headless REST API usage of the CMS since the content information is
returned as JSON and the rendering is actually done by the client application, e.g. the Intershop Progressive Web App.

If you want to use this component in your component model, please overwrite this template.
